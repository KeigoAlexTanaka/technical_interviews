Given a 32-bit signed integer, reverse digits of an integer.

Example 1:

Input: 123
Output: 321
Example 2:

Input: -123
Output: -321
Example 3:

Input: 120
Output: 21
Note:
Assume we are dealing with an environment which could only store integers within the 32-bit signed integer range: [−231,  231 − 1]. For the purpose of this problem, assume that your function returns 0 when the reversed integer overflows.

SOLUTION:

var reverse = function(x) {
    let num = x;
    if(x<0){
        num = x*-1;
    }
    let str = num +"";
    array=str.split("");
    if(x<0){
        array.push("-");
    }
    array=array.reverse();
    output=array.join("");
    if (output>2147483648 || output<-2147483647){
        return 0;
    }

    return output;
};

9. Palindrome Number
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

Input: 121
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Coud you solve it without converting the integer to a string?

SOLUTION:

var isPalindrome = function(x) {
    if(x<0){
        return false;
    }
    let str = x+"";
    let arr = str.split("");
    let reverse = Array.from(arr).reverse();
    arr=arr.join("");
    reverse=reverse.join("");
    if (arr==reverse){
        return true;
    }
    return false;
};

13. Roman to Integer

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

Symbol       Value
I             1
V             5
X             10
L             50
C             100
D             500
M             1000
For example, two is written as II in Roman numeral, just two one's added together. Twelve is written as, XII, which is simply X + II. The number twenty seven is written as XXVII, which is XX + V + II.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not IIII. Instead, the number four is written as IV. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as IX. There are six instances where subtraction is used:

I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.

Example 1:

Input: "III"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: "IV"
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: "IX"
Output: 9
Example 4:

Input: "LVIII"
Output: 58
Explanation: L = 50, V= 5, III = 3.
Example 5:

Input: "MCMXCIV"
Output: 1994
Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

SOLUTION:

var romanToInt = function(s) {
    let counter=0;
    for (let i=s.length;i>=0;i--){
        if(s[i]=="I"){
            counter+=1;
            if(s[i+1]=="V" || s[i+1]=="X"){
                counter-=2;
            }
        }
        if(s[i]=="V"){
            counter+=5;
        }
        if(s[i]=="X"){
            counter+=10;
            if(s[i+1]=="L" || s[i+1]=="C"){
                counter-=20;
            }
        }
        if(s[i]=="L"){
            counter+=50;
        }
        if(s[i]=="C"){
            counter+=100;
            if(s[i+1]=="D" || s[i+1]=="M"){
                counter-=200;
            }
        }
        if(s[i]=="D"){
            counter+=500;
        }
        if(s[i]=="M"){
            counter+=1000;
        }
    }
    return counter;
};

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/

14. Longest Common Prefix
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example 1:

Input: ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
Example 2:

All given inputs are in lowercase letters a-z.

SOLUTION:

var longestCommonPrefix = function(strs) {
    if (strs === undefined || strs.length == 0) {
        return "";
    }
    let first = strs[0];
    for (let i =1;i<strs.length;i++){
        while(strs[i].indexOf(first)!=0){
            first = first.substring(0, first.length-1);
            console.log(first,strs[i].indexOf(first));
        }
    }
    return first;

    return address = address.replace(/\./g, "[.]");
};

https://leetcode.com/problems/jewels-and-stones/

771. Jewels and Stones

You're given strings J representing the types of stones that are jewels, and S representing the stones you have.  Each character in S is a type of stone you have.  You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

The letters in J are guaranteed distinct, and all characters in J and S are letters. Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

Example 1:

Input: J = "aA", S = "aAAbbbb"
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: J = "z", S = "ZZ"
Output: 0
Note:

S and J will consist of letters and have length at most 50.
The characters in J are distinct.

var numJewelsInStones = function(J, S) {
    let counter=0;
    for (i in J){
        for (j in S){
            if (J[i]==S[j]){
                counter++;
            }
        }
    }
    return counter;
};

https://leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-of-bst/

938. Range Sum of BST
Given the root node of a binary search tree, return the sum of values of all nodes with value between L and R (inclusive).

The binary search tree is guaranteed to have unique values.

 

Example 1:

Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,null,18], L = 7, R = 15
Output: 32
Example 2:

Input: root = [10,5,15,3,7,13,18,1,null,6], L = 6, R = 10
Output: 23
 

Note:

The number of nodes in the tree is at most 10000.
The final answer is guaranteed to be less than 2^31.

SOLUTION (DEPTH FIRST SEARCH):

var rangeSumBST = function(root, L, R) {
    let sum = 0;
    if(root == null) {
        return 0;
    }
    if(L <= root.val && root.val <= R) {
        sum = root.val;
    }
    if(L <= root.val || R <= root.val) {
       sum += rangeSumBST(root.left, L, R);
   } 
   if(root.val <= L || root.val <= R){
       sum += rangeSumBST(root.right, L, R);
   }
    return sum;
};

709. To Lower Case
Implement function ToLowerCase() that has a string parameter str, and returns the same string in lowercase.

 

Example 1:

Input: "Hello"
Output: "hello"
Example 2:

Input: "here"
Output: "here"
Example 3:

Input: "LOVELY"
Output: "lovely"

SOLUTION:

var toLowerCase = function(str) {
    return str.toLowerCase();
};

1021. Remove Outermost Parentheses

A valid parentheses string is either empty (""), "(" + A + ")", or A + B, where A and B are valid parentheses strings, and + represents string concatenation.  For example, "", "()", "(())()", and "(()(()))" are all valid parentheses strings.

A valid parentheses string S is primitive if it is nonempty, and there does not exist a way to split it into S = A+B, with A and B nonempty valid parentheses strings.

Given a valid parentheses string S, consider its primitive decomposition: S = P_1 + P_2 + ... + P_k, where P_i are primitive valid parentheses strings.

Return S after removing the outermost parentheses of every primitive string in the primitive decomposition of S.

 

Example 1:

Input: "(()())(())"
Output: "()()()"
Explanation: 
The input string is "(()())(())", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" = "()()()".
Example 2:

Input: "(()())(())(()(()))"
Output: "()()()()(())"
Explanation: 
The input string is "(()())(())(()(()))", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())" + "(()(()))".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" + "()(())" = "()()()()(())".
Example 3:

Input: "()()"
Output: ""
Explanation: 
The input string is "()()", with primitive decomposition "()" + "()".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "" + "" = "".
 

Note:

S.length <= 10000
S[i] is "(" or ")"
S is a valid parentheses string

804. Unique Morse Code Words
International Morse Code defines a standard encoding where each letter is mapped to a series of dots and dashes, as follows: "a" maps to ".-", "b" maps to "-...", "c" maps to "-.-.", and so on.

For convenience, the full table for the 26 letters of the English alphabet is given below:

[".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.","--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..","--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.","...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-","-.--","--.."]
Now, given a list of words, each word can be written as a concatenation of the Morse code of each letter. For example, "cba" can be written as "-.-..--...", (which is the concatenation "-.-." + "-..." + ".-"). We'll call such a concatenation, the transformation of a word.

Return the number of different transformations among all words we have.

Example:
Input: words = ["gin", "zen", "gig", "msg"]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The transformation of each word is:
"gin" -> "--...-."
"zen" -> "--...-."
"gig" -> "--...--."
"msg" -> "--...--."

There are 2 different transformations, "--...-." and "--...--.".
Note:

The length of words will be at most 100.
Each words[i] will have length in range [1, 12].
words[i] will only consist of lowercase letters.

| Algeria      | 37100000    | 2381741      |
+--------------+-------------+--------------+

SOLUTION:

SELECT name, population, area from World WHERE (area>3000000 OR population>25000000)

https://leetcode.com/problems/flipping-an-image/

832. Flipping an Image

Given a binary matrix A, we want to flip the image horizontally, then invert it, and return the resulting image.

To flip an image horizontally means that each row of the image is reversed.  For example, flipping [1, 1, 0] horizontally results in [0, 1, 1].

To invert an image means that each 0 is replaced by 1, and each 1 is replaced by 0. For example, inverting [0, 1, 1] results in [1, 0, 0].

Example 1:

Input: [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,1,1],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]].
Then, invert the image: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Example 2:

Input: [[1,1,0,0],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Output: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Explanation: First reverse each row: [[0,0,1,1],[1,0,0,1],[1,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1]].
Then invert the image: [[1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0]]
Notes:

1 <= A.length = A[0].length <= 20
0 <= A[i][j] <= 1

SOLUTION:

var flipAndInvertImage = function(A) {
  let output=[];
  let newArr=[];
  const reverseRow = (arr) => {
      arr.reverse();
  }
  A.map(reverseRow)
  for ( i in  A ) {
    newArr=[];
    for (j in A[i]) {
      if (A[i][j]==[0]){
        newArr.push(1)
      }
      if (A[i][j]==[1]){
        newArr.push(0);
      }
    }
    output.push(newArr);
  }
  return output;
};
